Thin compatibility wrapper — re-exports everything from lazybridge.tools.doc_skills.

Prefer the canonical import:
    from lazybridge.tools.doc_skills import build_skill, skill_tool, skill_pipeline

This file exists so that scripts with the old import path continue to work:
    from doc_skills_tool import build_skill, skill_tool, skill_pipeline
